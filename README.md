# 🚀 EC2 Instance Setup with Secure SSH Access via PuTTY

This repository documents a hands-on deployment of an Amazon EC2 Linux instance, focusing on secure access using IAM roles and SSH connectivity via PuTTY. The project validates the setup using AWS CLI and follows security best practices suitable for real production environments.

## Overview

This is not a guided lab, but a practical setup that reflects how to securely configure and access an EC2 instance in a real-world scenario. Every step is carefully documented with commands, reasoning, and security considerations.

## 🛠️ What’s Covered

- Launching and configuring EC2 instances with appropriate security groups  
- Creating and managing secure access keys  
- Converting `.pem` key files to `.ppk` format for PuTTY authentication  
- Connecting to EC2 instances securely using PuTTY  
- Validating access with AWS CLI commands such as `aws iam list-users`  
- Applying security best practices across the entire stack
